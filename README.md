# MonsterCarePlus
In my Human-Computer Interaction Class, we were tasked with designing and 
creating a prototype of a health application. My team created Monster Care+.

A video explanation of our idea and implementation can be found at: https://youtu.be/rgI9ywlhiAg

Within this repository, a video walkthrough of the prototype is included, as well 
as a file of our third milestone which contains screenshots of the application and 
short descriptions of each feature.

For more information on each step in our process, here is a link to the website we 
created for the project: https://teamosasun.weebly.com/

The milestones show steps taken to create the prototype, including stakeholder analysis, 
throwaway prototyping steps, and user testing.
